# TADPol
Thematic Analysis of Data for the UK Police
MSc Computer Science final project - Marked at 82% (Distinction).

Supervisor: Dr Stuart Nicholson (Swansea University)

UK based police officers are striving to adapt to a changing world where digital technology plays a larger part in their day-to-day role. However, some core aspects of UK policing remain predominantly the same as they have always been but could greatly benefit from digital assistance.

Community engagement (where police conduct face-to-face interaction with the general public) is a traditional policing practice which more than often can generate large amounts of data (quotes, sentences, words etcâ€¦) which police are not necessarily skilled or equipped to analyse fully.

For this project, I independently learnt how to use Python and created a walkthrough qualitative analysis software platform called TADPol, using the TKinter library. This was a simple GUI which was intended to be intuitive and easy to use by police officers, where they can upload a formatted CSV file pre-populated with communty data. Officers can then highlight the relevant information that they require and export this to another CSV file, to assist them with performing qualitative analysis of large amounts of data. In addition to the software implementation aspect of the project, I also created associated training material as part of the dissertation.
