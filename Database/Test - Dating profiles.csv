1,Jessica,"I am tall, single(widowed), easy going, honest, good listener with a good sense of humour. Being a handyperson I keep busy working around the house, I also like to follow my favorite hockey team on TV or spoiling my two granddaughters when I get the chance!! I enjoy most music except Rap! I keep fit by jogging, walking and bicycling(at least three times a week). I have travelled to many places and RVd the SouthWest U.S., but I would now like to find that special travel partner to do more travel to warm and interesting countries. I now feel its time to meet a nice, kind, honest woman who has some of same interests as I do; to share the happy times, quiet times and adventures together.",I am tall single(widowed),Tall," I keep fit by jogging, walking and bicycling(at least three times a week)",Fitness,,,,,,
2,Kate,"I enjoy photography, lapidary & seeking collectables in the form of classic movies & 33 1/3, 45 & 78 RPM recordings from the 1920's, 30's & 40's. I am retired & looking forward to travelling Canada, the USA, the UK & Europe, China if time allows. I am unique inasmuch as I do not judge a book by it's cover, I accept people for who they are. I will not demand or request perfection from anyone until such time as I am perfect, so I guess that means everyone is safe. My musical tastes range from Classical, big band era, early jazz, classic 50's & 60's rock & roll & country since it's inception.",,,,,,,,,,
